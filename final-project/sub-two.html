            <h1>Lessons Aren't For You?</h1>
            <p>Don't worry, lessons are for everybody. Sometimes we don't have as much time as we would like or money
                may be tight. Here are some resources I have used to teach myself the guitar over the past few years. A
                good
                mixture of learning techniques and playing quickly alongside the fundamentals of guitar theory. Here are
                two
                websites I've used in the past to learn and progress my skills.
