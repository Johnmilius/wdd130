            <h1>My Guitar Learning Journey</h1>

            <h2>A Rocky Start: Part 1</h2>
            <p> My journey to learning the guitar began in a rather unconventional way. When I was in the 7th grade, I
                thought it would be incredibly cool to try my hand at the guitar. My mom, always supportive of my whims,
                enrolled me in group guitar lessons at a nearby music store. However, the content didn't resonate with
                me. We were learning songs like "Mary Had a Little Lamb" and reading from sheet music, which utterly
                failed to capture my interest and excitement. In hindsight, this wasn't the ideal start for my musical
                adventure, but it was a beginning nonetheless. </p>

            <h2>An Unexpected Mentor: Part 2</h2>
            <p> I only attended the music store classes for a few months before my enthusiasm waned, leaving me feeling
                discouraged and unmotivated to try again. However, an unexpected twist came later that year. My mom
                received a call from a close friend who had recently been diagnosed with cancer. In an effort to
                distract himself from his medical condition, he graciously offered to teach me guitar in a one-on-one
                setting. This marked a significant turning point in my journey. </p>

            <h2>Finding My Groove: Part 3</h2>
            <p> Over the next three years, I took lessons from him in a much more engaging and supportive environment.
                His personalized teaching methods and the material we covered resonated deeply with me, sparking a
                genuine passion for the instrument. These lessons were not just about learning to play; they were about
                connecting with the music on a deeper level and discovering the joy of creating melodies. </p>

            <h2>Striking a Chord on My Own: Part 4</h2>
            <p> After those three transformative years, I continued to teach myself, diving into the vast world of
                guitar on my own. I discovered new skills and techniques, experimenting with different styles and
                genres. Along the way, I found effective methods to self-learn new songs and developed valuable insights
                that have not only enhanced my playing but also allowed me to help others on their musical journeys.
