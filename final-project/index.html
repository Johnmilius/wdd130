          <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
          <p>
            From an early age, my life has been guided by a profound curiosity
            and a passion for continuous learning and growth. The guitar, in
            particular, has been a significant part of this journey. Over the
            past few years, it has profoundly impacted my mental health,
            bringing peace and strengthening my connections with friends and
            family. Performing and sharing the joy of music through gatherings
            has allowed me to highlight the light and beauty that the guitar
            brings. With eight years of playing experience, I have chronicled my
            journey from the beginning, demonstrating the transformative power
            of this instrument. Now, as a 21-year-old college student pursuing a
            bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I remain eager to help others
            discover the guitar's wonders and how it can enrich their lives.

        <h1>My Guitar Learning Journey</h1>

        <h2>A Rocky Start: Part 1</h2>
        <p>
          My journey to learning the guitar began in a rather unconventional
          way. When I was in the 7th grade, I thought it would be incredibly
          cool to try my hand at the guitar. My mom, always supportive of my
          whims, enrolled me in group guitar lessons at a nearby music store.
          However, the content didn't resonate with me. We were learning songs
          like "Mary Had a Little Lamb" and reading from sheet music, which
          utterly failed to capture my interest and excitement. In hindsight,
          this wasn't the ideal start for my musical adventure, but it was a
          beginning nonetheless.
        </p>

        <h2>An Unexpected Mentor: Part 2</h2>
        <p>
          I only attended the music store classes for a few months before my
          enthusiasm waned, leaving me feeling discouraged and unmotivated to
          try again. However, an unexpected twist came later that year. My mom
          received a call from a close friend who had recently been diagnosed
          with cancer. In an effort to distract himself from his medical
          condition, he graciously offered to teach me guitar in a one-on-one
          setting. This marked a significant turning point in my journey.
        </p>

        <h2>Finding My Groove: Part 3</h2>
        <p>
          Over the next three years, I took lessons from him in a much more
          engaging and supportive environment. His personalized teaching methods
          and the material we covered resonated deeply with me, sparking a
          genuine passion for the instrument. These lessons were not just about
          learning to play; they were about connecting with the music on a
          deeper level and discovering the joy of creating melodies.
        </p>

        <h2>Striking a Chord on My Own: Part 4</h2>
        <p>
          After those three transformative years, I continued to teach myself,
          diving into the vast world of guitar on my own. I discovered new
          skills and techniques, experimenting with different styles and genres.
          Along the way, I found effective methods to self-learn new songs and
          developed valuable insights that have not only enhanced my playing but
          also allowed me to help others on their musical journeys.
