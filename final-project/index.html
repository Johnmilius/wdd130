            <h1>My Guitar Learning Journey</h1>
            <h2>Part 1</h2>
            <p>
                My journey to learning the guitar began in an unconventional way. In the 7th grade, I thought it would
                be cool to try out the guitar, so my mom enrolled me in group guitar lessons at a nearby music store.
                Unfortunately, the content didn't resonate with me. We were learning songs like "Mary Had a Little Lamb"
                and reading from sheet music, which failed to capture my interest. In hindsight, this wasn't the ideal
                start for me.
            </p>
            <h2>Part 2</h2>
            <p>I only attended the music store classes for a few months before losing interest. I felt discouraged and
                wasn't eager to try again. However, my journey took an unexpected turn later that year when my mom
                received a call from a close friend who had been diagnosed with cancer. In an effort to distract himself
                from his medical condition, he offered to teach me guitar in a one-on-one setting.
            </p>
            <h2>Part 3</h2>
            <p>For the next three years, I took lessons from him in a much better environment. His personalized teaching
                methods and the material we covered made sense to me and kept me engaged. </p>
            <h2>Part 4</h2>
            <p>After those three years, I continued to teach myself, discovering new skills and techniques. I've found
                effective ways to self-learn new songs and have gained valuable insights into helping others on their
                musical journeys. </p>
