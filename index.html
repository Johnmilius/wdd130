    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>John Milius</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! I'm from Huntington Beach California. I've lived there for most of my life. I just recently got back from my mission serving in the Colorado Denver North Mission.</p>
    <p>Before my mission I attended a Community college locally near me called Orange Coast College. I did that for two semesters before making the decision to transfer over to BYU Idaho. I'm currently studying for a Computer Science degree. I want to work somewhere in the technology field.</p>
    <p>Some things that I like to do are going to the gym, when I live in California I spend a lot of time in the ocean surfing, and I love playing the guitar and anything that has to do with music.</p>
    <p>I also spent a lot of my time growing up playing soccer and I will be trying to join one of the intermural sports for soccer.</p>
    <p>Here is an image of my family. We just went on a family trip to New York and then dropped my younger sister off at Southern Virginia Univirsity.</p>
